IEEE activities promote research culture by awarding research grants and publishing research papers. The penchant for discovering new horizons in research areas and exploring new technologies has lead to the formation of the IEEE student chapter of LDRP-ITR. Since its inception the aim of our student branch has been to organize technical and non-technical events during the course of time. By organizing such activities the students not only gain sound technical knowledge but are imbibed with leadership skills and team work. These qualities form an integral part of their multifaceted development. Our endeavor is to organize IEEE activities on a regular basis along with healthy participation from members of various student branches.</p>
